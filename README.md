### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm N, I just graduated Duke University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Economics.

Here's some stuff I worked on before:
- iMessageWrapped, an iMessage analytics and automation platform to drive relational insights about your texting habits
- Pingr, an automated iMessage broadcasting platform
- HackDuke, Duke's annual hackathon
