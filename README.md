### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm N, a senior at Duke University studying Computer Science and Economics.
Here's a couple things I'm doing right now:
- currently working on iMessageWrapped, an iMessage analytics and automation platform to drive relational insights about your texting habits
- building a locally hosted mint clone using Plaid (but maybe I'll switch to teller.io)
- leading product & strategy for BlueRide, a rideshare cost-saving program for Duke students
